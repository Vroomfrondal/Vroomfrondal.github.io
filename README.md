# Christopher's Personal Portfolio Website

This is an HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JS template I used to develop my personal portfolio website. The purpose of this project was to better understand detailed front-end code rather than the introductory work I developed in my previous project: the Fitness Website (which is also a public repo on my github)

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML 5
- CSS
- Javascript
- Vscode
- Github
